# Andre's Creative Coding Archive

A few of my source codes that I still found on my computer. 
They were part or should have been part of some graphics sub-projects.


## [Runner](./runner/)

OpenSCAD code to draw running figure wireframes.
Inspired by a similar CPC6128 home computer program from my childhood in the early 1990s, 
whose name I unfortunately no longer remember (Runner Simulator?)

## [Collage](./collage/)

Javascript/CSS to generate collages from some given images.
Currently it reproduces the style of Jelle Marten's "[In The Quivering Forest](https://www.google.com/search?q=Jelle+Martens+%22In+The+Quivering+Forest%22&tbm=isch)" only. 
It creates and composes SVG _patterns_ instead of drawing on a HTML5 canvas.
